eql
=======

eql is a mathematical grammar meant for simple keyboard only calculations. The purpose is to enable low friction calculations that I've grown accustomed to on my Casio fx-260SOLAR.

# Command line usage
Place the cli.py script in your bin/ folder (I named mine `=` so it's accessible from anywhere as `=`, example: `= 2+2`).

If you want to use the optional sympy evaluator, you'll need to install sympy version 1.9 (or greater)
